= Introduction =

The Blackboard Event Processor is a Java based implementation of the blackboard design paradigm. The blackboard design paradigm facilitates the organization of chunks of information for processing by loosely coupled software processes. These chunks of information are stored in the blackboard's central data repository. This central data repository is accessible by all participating software processes.

Software processes can add, update, and remove chunks of information in the repository. The blackboard design paradigm provides for data change notification services to the participating software processes, and provides for the scheduling of those software processes that wish to effect changes on the chunks of information in the repository. The diagram below illustrates the relationship among the data, software processes, and the blackboard in a hypothetical patient management application.
